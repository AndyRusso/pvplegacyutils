# Dependencies & Incompatibilities
The mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to work.

For configuration, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config). Though, the mod will work without them.

I have not discovered any incompatibilities yet.
